#Medical Chatbot
This repository contains a medical chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide safer and more context-aware responses for health-related queries. The project follows the architecture demonstrated in the referenced YouTube tutorial, adapting it into a customizable codebase suitable for local experimentation and learning.​

#Features
Answers medical questions using a combination of a language model and document retrieval for domain-specific context.​

Uses vector embeddings and a vector database to search relevant medical content before generating responses.​

Simple web UI for interactive chat, inspired by the tutorial’s Streamlit-based interface.​

#Tech stack
RAG pipeline with an open-source LLM specialized for medical or general QA tasks.​

Embedding model plus a vector store (such as FAISS or Qdrant) for efficient similarity search.​

Python for backend logic and a lightweight web framework for the frontend chat interface.​​

#Disclaimer
This chatbot is for educational and experimental purposes only and must not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical decisions.
