**Medical Chatbot**

This repository hosts a medical chatbot built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver accurate and context-aware responses to health-related queries. The system leverages a combination of advanced language models and medical document retrieval, making it suitable for research, education, and local experimentation in the healthcare domain.​

**Features**
Provides medical information by retrieving relevant documents and generating context-specific answers.​

Utilizes vector embeddings and a vector database (such as FAISS or Qdrant) to efficiently search for and retrieve medical content before generating responses.​

Features a simple web-based user interface for interactive chat, allowing users to ask health questions and receive informative answers.​

**Tech Stack**
RAG pipeline powered by an open-source large language model (LLM) tailored for medical or general question-answering tasks.​

Embedding models and vector databases for robust semantic search and retrieval of medical texts.​

Python-based backend logic with a lightweight web framework (such as Streamlit) for the frontend chat interface.​

**Disclaimer**
This chatbot is intended for educational and experimental purposes only. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for any medical concerns.
